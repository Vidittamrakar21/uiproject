                    <p>A fully fledged movie show booking web application built with MERN Stack. For Backend ðŸš€ <br />I've used Node.js , Express.js for creating server and APIs <br />As API of theatres and movies was not available for me , I created all the APIs by my itself that's why, the movies listed are old because, I started making APIs 1.5 months back and by seeing the complexity, I created for only 4 cities of Madhya Pradesh ie Jabalpur, Indore, Bhopal and Gwalior.<br />For payment, I integrated Razor pay Gateway, currently it is working in test environment
                    <br />For authentication, I've used firebase and JWT  <br />For Frontend<br />I've used React.js , Redux , and few npm packages.I took the reference for UI from BookMyShow I aslo implemented movie filtering feature and searching feature .<br /> </p>
